# FIGBERT.COM
The official website and home of FIGBERT on the clearnet.

This site should serve as a place for me to put finished programs, write-throughs, things I find interesting, photos of me from around the world, and other information about me. ~~Also my resume cuz self-promotion.~~

## Current Programs
* figENC
    * An RSA encryption app built with python3 and tkinter to encrypt files of any type and size with the maximum possible security.
* Websites
    * figbert.com
    * daniel4tiburon.com
* figbertMath
    * A calculator for miscellaneous common math problems I encounter that I ~~am too lazy to do by hand~~ think should be automated.
