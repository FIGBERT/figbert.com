# figbert.com
[figbert.com][figbert] is the official website and home of FIGBERT on the clearnet.

## About
The site is made with [Zola][zola] to host my blog, portfolio, and other information about me and my life. It is built using custom templates that I am converting into a
standalone theme. The design of the site is inspired by a number of sites and themes, including: [Daring Fireball][df], [Archie][archie], [Bear][bear], [Twenty Twenty][2020] and
many others. Blog posts are written in a combination of [CommonMark][commonmark] and [Tera][tera] [shortcodes][shortcodes].

## Licenses
The site's CSS and templating are licensed under [GNU GPLv3][gpl]. I am in the process of converting them into a full-fledged theme, which will be released under the same
license. The textual content of the site (biographical information, blog posts, etc) are the copyright of FIGBERT, all rights reserved. Emojis designed by [OpenMoji][emoji] â€“
