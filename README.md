# figbert.com (v2)

[figbert.com](https://figbert.com/) is the official website and home of FIGBERT on the clearnet.

This site is programmed with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Source code screenshots are generated with [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/). Posts are converted from Markdown to HTML using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), and [a custom Python script](markdown/export.py).

I'm going to replace this README once I write a blog post about the redesign, so enjoy this version while it lasts.
