# [figbert.com](https://figbert.com/)
[figbert.com](https://figbert.com/) is the official website and home of FIGBERT on the clearnet.

## Development
This version of the site is being programmed at the same time as a branch developed with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Routify](https://routify.dev/). Whichever branch ends
up suiting my needs better will be pushed to the production environment. The main benefit of developing with Svelte is to keep myself as close to the HTML/CSS as possible while
maintaining the benefits of developing with a modern framework. The main benefit of developing with Zola is that Javascript and NPM are horrible and I hate them.

## About
The site is programmed with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to host my blog, portfolio, and other information about me and my life. The site has gone through several iterations
and rewrites over the past year – the goal of this version is to simplify, secure, and speed up my previous site to provide a better user experience.

The design of the site is inspired by a number of sites and themes, including: [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/), [Archie](https://themes.gohugo.io/archie/),
[Bear](https://bearblog.dev/), [txtodo](https://txtodo.app/), [Twenty Twenty](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/) and many others. The site is also inspired by a site I
lost to time – it was a black-on-white website with beautiful `<hr/>`-separated lists and incredible use of emojis (which actually inspired my own use of
[OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/)). If this site sounds familiar, don't hesitate to reach out as I would love to credit it here.
