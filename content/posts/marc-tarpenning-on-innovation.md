I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to hear Marc Tarpenning,
cofounder of Tesla, speak at the beginning of this quarter. It was the
most exciting and impactful talk I've attended at Stanford thus far.
This is really saying something.

In his talk, Tarpenning elucidated a theory of innovation and disruption
that feels to me to have been "lost to time." It is a measured,
idea-first strategy that is totally foreign to the current generation of
startups and to a world in which "founder" is itself a career.

[Sara Singer] condensed his theory into a wonderful diagram that I have
further developed into the following list (broad principles are bolded,
with the specific examples from Tarpenning's time at Tesla in the normal
weight):

1. **Identify a real problem. Prove it exists with real-world data.
   Narrow down your search area by taking the age-old wisdom seriously:
   "if something can't go on forever, it won't." Create the solution
   that will replace it.** At Tesla, Marc and his cofounder Martin
   Eberhard wanted to help solve the issue of climate change. The DoE
   projected in 2008 that over 70% of U.S. oil demand came from
   the transportation sector, and others have calculated that
   decarbonizing road transportation "could feasibly reduce global
   emissions by 11.9%" ([The Carbon Almanac], pp. 67). Without any
   action, climate change would end the world. The scenario they
   identified thus fits the above model—a problem that exists and a
   solution that must arrive eventually. So they set out to build a car
   without emissions.
2. **Evaluate your solutions. Prove that it will work, mathematically,
   before you start building. Your product cannot be better along just a
   single-axis if you want to change people's behavior; make a [Pareto
   improvement]. Do the hardest thing first to learn if your solution is
   possible.** Marc and Martin evaluated two things: the technology and
   the market. First, they exhaustively investigated possible power
   sources before deciding that batteries had reached the right
   power density and mass-producibility to be—provably—the most
   effective alternative to gasoline. Even powered by coal generators,
   an electric car is less polluting per mile than an ICE vehicle due to
   the efficiency of the electric motor (significantly less energy
   wasted as heat, thus more energy toward movement). On the market
   front, they found that upper-class Americans were seeking out
   environmentally-friendly vehicles as a status symbol—with the Prius
   eating into Lexus sales, and GM having to physically claw back their
   [EV1] from leasers. Without scale, their first car would be
   expensive, but it being the only vehicle to truly satisfy this niche
   meant if the tech worked they would find buyers. Finally, their
   solution wasn't just technically better for customers with its
   radical efficiency: it was fun, sexy. The rise of electric cars has
   made them feel normal, but Tarpenning described the "electric smile,"
   a meme they threw around at Tesla in the early days to describe the
   reaction that drivers had from the very first moment they pressed the
   pedal and felt the instant torque.
3. **Change the world. The shape of progress is not inevitable, we make
   it. [Success is assured only in retrospect.][jobs]** Tarpenning
   advocated for a goal of "sustainable abundance," forged from a fusion
   of technological advancement, government buy-in, and behavioral
   change.

A lot of software businesses have none of these qualities.
