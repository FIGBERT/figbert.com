Today, I'm going to talk about [this video][vid].

A short time ago, I found myself on the Stanford University campus. I
grabbed a quick bite to eat at [Tootsies]. Against the wall, I noticed a
large black-and-white machine. It had an almost Apple-esque minimalism,
with brass details accentuating its design. I was fascinated, and
appreciatively took note of its [Bellwether Coffee] insignia. I figured
it likely originated with one of the area's indigenous startup fauna.

Not long after, I saw a video pop up in my YouTube subscriptions by one
[James Hoffmann]. I'm not terribly engaged in the world of coffee, but
I do quite like James.

Lo and behold, the video began and James Hoffmann was sitting atop a
Bellwether Roaster! Glorious. I thoroughly enjoyed the video, drafted up
a blog post in appreciation of the gleeful coincidence, and here I am
half a year later publishing it.

If you haven't seen the video yet, I beg you [give it a watch.][vid]

Here's to serendipity.
