[There is a feeling coursing through the populace.] It is just now
bubbling over, spilling through the cracks and taking its many shapes.
The world changed forever with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007—it
is a fool who thinks it can't change again. I am a fool who thinks it is
going to change very imminently.

These two sentences represent the prevailing wisdom on mobile computing.
Not just that consumer hardware is hard—it is, with even great successes
like [Pebble] eventually collapsing—but that it's not worth pursuing:
that we've already figured it out. It's the most dominant form of
technology worldwide. Billions of people make their digital homes on
their phones. Surely that means the field is done.

To my mind, this has always sounded ignorant. Look at your phone: it's a
rectangular screen. What is this optimized for? What does this form
factor make easy? The screen is a blank canvas. It enables Jobs' vision
of a device that doesn't need physical updates to gain new
functionality. But it's also profoundly lazy. It is the lowest common
denominator of interfaces.

The screen is also uniquely condemnable for the way it inherently
hijacks our attention. Our brains are ill-prepared to encounter the
light of a thousand suns or colors more vibrant than any Amazonian tree
frog, but that's what we see when we check our phones at 3am. Try and
have a conversation with a phone in your peripheral vision. Play a video
with the sound on mute: can you avoid distraction? Alternatively: could
you actually recognize the contours of your palm? The common turn of
phrase would suggest this to be the most familiar thing in the world. I
suspect we all know our home screen much better.

At the same time as I am thoroughly steeped in technology, I hate it. I
want to maximize the amount of time I spend present with the people I
love: my friends, my family, random kind and exciting people. The time I
spend "in" a device—the fact that such a turn of phrase even exists—is
despicable, in my eyes. And I'm not alone in this:

> If you’re looking at a phone more than someone’s eyes, you’re doing

The status of this crusade, as it stands, is a bit of a mixed bag. On
the one hand, there are a metric ton of reasons to despair: there's a
whole generation of "iPad kids" out there who have grown up breaking
Cook's ironic axiom above. I myself just quit a Reels addiction. The
status quo is riddled with the ills of our devices, from the wasteland
of social media to the phantom notifications plaguing our pockets.
However, there is some cause for hope and excitement: that feeling I
mentioned earlier. People don't just live amidst all the garbage—they're
starting to feel it.

Some of these people are seeking to do something about it all.
Throughout the industry there are new takes on what the coming device
paradigm might look like: new minds finally tackling the question of
what it should look like to live alongside our technology. Obviously,
none of them have come close to supplanting the phone or the laptop or
the *screen* at all. Not just yet. But I hope they will, eventually, and
I want to be a part of that.

There are numerous significant and cool initiatives in this area these
days. [Humane] has been universally panned but I'm extremely interested
in rapidly developing their laser display technology as an alternative
to traditional display panels. [Origami Computing] is actually the
reason I'm writing this post, because I promised Sarvasv I would do so
over six months ago and I want to reply to his email. I steal his line
about the love-hate relationship we have with our devices all the time.
The [Apple Vision Pro] may initially seem like its going the exact
opposite direction of what I'm advocating in this post, but if you look
at it closely you realize that it too is seeking to eliminate the role
screens play in our lives today. [tinyPod] is such a compelling reason
to buy an Apple Watch that I might actually do it. I own the [reMarkable
2] and use it every day for school: for years it replaced all my paper
use, though I've built up a nasty habit of of sketching and journaling
on dead trees again. I met an angel investor in [Daylight] on a flight
to New York—I'm most interested in their tablet because it runs full
Android, and there are good apps I use on my phone that I wish I could
use on an e-ink-ish display. I have similar feelings toward the [Palma].
I'm not sure that [Freewrite] belongs among this new wave, because
they've been around for a while, but it is yet another e-ink device that
I want to buy. Limitless' [pendant] and Avi's [friend] strike me as
products similiarly oriented around the question "what if a microphone
was maximally intelligent?" [Spatial Pixel] gives strong
[tldraw]/[todepond]/[Ink & Switch] vibes, as well as relying on cool
projection technology that we've previously established I'm a fan of.
The [Oura Ring] is not as much of a general computing device as the rest
of these, but it has the great quality of [delivering utility] to me on
a daily basis while not having a screen, so it has won a spot. And
frankly: [Roll Call] was inspired by this very scene/movement and [was
explicitly] an expirement in alternative display technology!

Gruber wrote the sharpest critique of these sorts of efforts two years
ago when the Ai Pin was first announced, in a post entitled *[If You
Come at the King]*. In essence, he says that Humane's founder, Imran
Chaudhri, may be right that our phone addictions are sad and
problematic. However, he points out, people don't care. The objective
truth has no bearing on the fact that everyone *loves* their phone.
Addicts love their compulsions, even when they know they're
self-destructive. I agree with Gruber. But I think that the need is too
dire to simply give up. We need a [Pareto improvement] in our mobile
devices: new digital companions that are not only healthier for us, but
that we love even more. People won't change their behavior for abstract
concepts like well-being, but they will absolutely change their behavior
for *better*.

And something better is possible. We do not have to take the good with
the bad. A more humanistic future is out there: one with technology that
is helpful and ubiquitous but totally dissolved into the background of
our existence. We have designed our present, and we can design a future
with all of its benefits and none of its downsides. We must right our
priorities by building a better system on the back of the one that came
before. There is no area of more impact than hardware, and no better
time to [experiment] [wildly]. It is time to build new hardware. It is
time to turn our focus to the world we were given.
