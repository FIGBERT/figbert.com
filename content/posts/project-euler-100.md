## Introduction
---
I am officially starting the Project Euler 100 challenge! The Dark Souls of Coding Achievements! This post will serve 
as the hub of this new project, and I'll update it frequently with any new information. I plan to program my solutions 
in Python, but may alternate between a few other languages or take the opportunity to learn a new one.

### Challenges
* **Challenge #1**
    * [Walkthrough][w1]
    * [Solution][s1]
