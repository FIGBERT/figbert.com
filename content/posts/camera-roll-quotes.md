I have been collecting fun little writings in Photos with the intent of
distributing them here. Now I can delete them. This will lift a great
weight from my shoulders.

"Close lookin."

> Musk, via email, would only say: "I have never lost money for those
> who invest in me and I am not starting now."

From an Axios article, in response to a question about X/Twitter. Seems
ill-fated, but an impressive display of confidence.

> Argentina, back in its familiar position of being a fiscal and
> economic disaster zone...

Funny, for me, far away from Argentina.

> This put him in position to try the Hitler Slingshot Maneuver...

Hell of a maneuver.

> The old mantra's gotta go, even as it still rings in our ears and
> echoes down deep caverns of the Web.

A metaphor that makes the Web a physical place is good in my book.

> We're imagination bottlenecked. There's low-hanging fruit for the next
> decade.

A fun but frustrating concept. How to come up with radical ideas...

From Manu's lovely *People and Blogs*, the [fourth edition]. A
philosophy I agree with, even if I am not huge on truffle brownies
myself.

> Don't avoid places with beautiful women in them, ignore who's already
> there and take a beautiful woman with you, or at least one who looks
> beautiful in bistro lighting. Trust me, the food tastes better.

From one of the most [bizarre and beautiful screeds] I've ever
encountered.

> Let the coffee be hot, & the liquors chosen with special care.

A local restaurant menu.
