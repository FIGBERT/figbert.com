This challenge was another 5% difficulty one (as rated by [Project Euler][3]), and I continued to write my solutions 
in Python for this one as well. In this challenge, I was tasked to:

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
> first 10 terms will be:
> 
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

To solve the challenge, I wrote another two functions. The first function, `fib`, accepts an integer prop `limit` and 
returns a list containing the Fibonacci sequence up until the passed property. The second function, `sumOfEvensInList`, 
accepts a list prop `srcList` and iterates over every number in the list, appending the number to another list, `lst`, 
if the number is even. The function then returns the sum of all the numbers in the list using `sum()`.

The [final code][code] looks like this:
```python3
# problemName = "Even Fibonacci numbers"
# problemNum = 2
# solutionBy = "FIGBERT"
# language = "Python"
# dateCompleted = "20/01/2020"

def fib(limit):
    lst = [1,2]
    while lst[-1] <= limit:
        lst.append(lst[-2] + lst[-1])
    return lst

def sumOfEvensInList(srcList):
    lst = []
    for i in srcList:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            lst.append(i)
    return sum(lst)

fibUntil4Mil = fib(4000000)
answer = sumOfEvensInList(fibUntil4Mil)
print((
    "By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not "
    "exceed four million, the sum of the even-valued terms is {}".format(answer)
))
```
