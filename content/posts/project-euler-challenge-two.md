This challenge was another 5% difficulty one (as rated by [Project Euler][3]), and I continued to write my solutions 
in Python for this one as well. In this challenge, I was tasked to:

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
> first 10 terms will be:
> 
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

To solve the challenge, I wrote another two functions. The first function, `fibonacci`, accepts an integer prop `limit` and 
returns a list containing the Fibonacci sequence up until the passed property. The second function, `sum_of_evens_in_list`, 
accepts a list prop `src_list` and iterates over every number in the list, appending the number to another list, `list_`, 
if the number is even. The function then returns the sum of all the numbers in the list using `sum()`.

The [final code][code] looks like this:
```python3
# problemName = "Even Fibonacci numbers"
# problemNum = 2
# solutionBy = "FIGBERT"
# language = "Python"
# dateCompleted = "20/01/2020"

def fibonacci(limit):
    list_ = [1,2]
    while list_[-1] <= limit:
        list_.append(list_[-2] + list_[-1])
    return list_

def sum_of_evens_in_list(src_list):
    list_ = []
    for i in src_list:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            list_.append(i)
    return sum(list_)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fibonacci_until_4_mil = fibonacci(4000000)
    answer = sum_of_evens_in_list(fibonacci_until_4_mil)
    print((
        "By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do "
        "not exceed four million, the sum of the even-valued terms is "
        "{}".format(answer)
    ))
```
