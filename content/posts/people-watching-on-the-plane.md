Everybody has to entertain themselves somehow on fifteen hour flights.
Some people watch movies. I watch people watch movies and make a list of
them to post on my blog.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Bullet Train</strong></summary>
  I like this movie, good on you whoever you are.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Don't Worry Darling</strong></summary>
  Been on the periphery of my watchlist for a minute now. From my
  limited perspective watching without sound on a tiny plane screen made
  even smaller by the fact that it's someone else's sitting down the
  aisle, it has compelling visuals. Going to move it up on my list.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Mud, Sweat, and Beards</strong></summary>
  Uhhh...
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Lightyear</strong></summary>
  I want to give this a try, but I'm fairly certain that I'm going to
  stop before I finish it because it'll feel like a waste of my life.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>
    Stanley Tucci Searching for Italy
  </strong></summary>
  This might actually be titled <em>Umbria</em>. Seems rather pleasant
  in any case.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Where The Crawdads Sing</strong></summary>
  I feel like I've heard of this but I have no idea what it actually is.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>
    The Movie Where Idris Elba is a Sex Genie for the Older White Woman
  </strong></summary>
  This movie is called <em>Three Thousand Years of Longing</em>. Tip of
  my tongue, I swear!
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>
    The Movie Where Liam Neeson (I Think?) Makes the Classic Meme Phone
    Threat
  </strong></summary>
  IGN says this is called <em>Taken</em>.
</details>

The `<details>` element is really fun and I should use it more. Though
it does lead to a scary amount of `HTML` in my Markdown.

There are four hours left on this return flight and I've expended all
the blog post ideas that I came up with on the flight over. Going to
have to find something else to do now.
