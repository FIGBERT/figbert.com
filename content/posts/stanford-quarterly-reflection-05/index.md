Last year my friends would often pointedly remind me that I was a
freshman. So it's been a little weird this quarter no longer holding
that title. However, as far as beginnings go, I'd say it's off to a fine
start.

### Academics

This quarter is what Stanford is supposed to be. I learned. A ton. I was
enrolled in:

1. MATH 21: Calculus
2. COMPLIT 37Q: Zionism and the Novel
3. SUSTAIN 345: Sustainable Societies Lab
4. DESIGN 11: Visual Thinking
5. CS 148: Introduction to Computer Graphics and Imaging

The extent to which I was actually *in* MATH 21, despite my enrollment,
is somewhat questionable. I attended very few lectures, and I think
possibly two discussion sections. On balance, I think this was alright.
I obviously didn't derive as much as I could have from the course (pun
intended), but I performed adequately and had more time to devote to
things that interested me far more. This is despite my liking the
professor: when I did manage to show up for lecture, I felt a bit like I
was participating in the mathematical world of yore. The class did
manage to have a statistically significant impact on my sleep though!
See if you can guess when the problem sets were due:

Zionism and the Novel was a real treat. The [syllabus](syllabus.pdf) was
so interesting that I felt guilty any time I had to skip a reading, and
promised to catch up on it at a later date for my own good. I'm still
working on that. I also ended up sharing [a lot] of [my writing] from
the course on this site, which is a very nice plus.

The Sustainable Societies Lab continues to be a blast (I participated in
another incarnation of it [last spring]). We heard from a number of
deeply knowledgeable speakers from a broad range of fields. I was blown
away by Marc Tarpenning, which also made [its way] into [some posts]
here. I also strongly disagreed with the founder of Beyond Meat, and
will attribute any future failure to his attitude and any future success
to pure luck. The latter half of that sentence is a joke.

DESIGN 11, my [old nemesis][last spring], was possibly my favorite
class. It was certainly the most impactful—I think I will never look at
the world the same way after taking it. The class forced me to become
comfortable sitting in the liminal space of making things. There are
very few ventures that you can be sure of before embarking upon them.
Most entail some space in between, where each step from the start takes
you further toward your ultimate destination. Some steps are misplaced,
mistakes that you have to recognize and adapt to instead of abandoning
your progress and starting again from scratch. This process must feel
like home to you if you want to make something. The class instigates
this change in its students by forcing you to do the things you're bad
at, over and over again. First the stakes are low: building little
one-off thingamajigs and prototypes. And then you're thrown directly in
the fire and made to combine those little skills you didn't even realize
you were learning to make something real. We did that three times:
carving and constructing an [automaton] from foam core, abusing [Figma]
to make a functional digital [vending machine], and the final open-ended
project that ultimately coalesced into [Roll Call]. I am grateful to
Patrick Fenton, who made this a comfortable place to grow, and to Vivek
for pushing me through the course when I needed an extra shove and
making building things a total blast. Also I sort of learned to draw:

![Pages from my workbook. We were tasked with outlining 50 "bugs" in the
day-to-day lives of ourselves and others.](drawings.pdf)

CS 148 was another fun class—I took this one at Naama's behest, and
found the [final project] in particular a good opportunity to implement
the techniques for making that I had picked up in DESIGN 11. The class
was scheduled at the same time as DESIGN 11, so I never actually
attended a lecture, but I'm theoretically a fan of the professor because
he has two Oscars for inventing the math behind CGI and was a
[professional bodybuilder] in his youth (scroll to the bottom of that
link). It had been a long time since I [worked with Blender], so it was
fun to get back at it! I felt a lot more confident building things
independently this time around, which I would attribute to my growth in
many contributing areas and skillsets—quite satisfying.

This quarter lacked a structured avenue for me to engage with political
thought. Zionism and the Novel came close, and I certainly engage
seriously on a myriad of political issues in discussions with my
friends, but I still felt something of a void. All of which is to say
that I declared a PoliSci minor on the International Relations track,
which will hopefully keep me entertained in this respect going foreword.
They also gave me a funky shirt when I declared, which Design didn't, so
extra points to their department.

### Personal

This was the quarter of Junch and the Sleepoverers. Odin and my
membership in both groups means that we technically won the quarter.
Every week was marked by me getting progressively more excited until I
actually arrived at Junch and then seven days of comedown until the next
one arrived. Our more ambitious schedule for this upcoming quarter is
going to be epic; I just hope Naama and Jordan can keep up. The
Sleepoverers were my people for these past few months. If I had
downtime, I was with Nageena, Lulu, and Daniel. What a squad we were—the
half of our contingent that are going off to Paris this upcoming quarter
will be dearly missed.

My roommate this year is no longer random: I'm living with Vivek! Who
would have thought that we would be living together, four years after we
first met each other and thought the other one was super weird. Our room
is a total blast. It really is as simple as Vivek told my dad: "we like
the same snacks." Here's to next quarter, when my morning classes might
finally force me to adopt his sleep schedule.

I've created some clean delineations above for the sake of the post, but
of course reality is much messier. Jack and Zach, besides rhyming, are
pillars of my existence here at Stanford. I look forward to more GSB
library study sessions and rapid costume creation, respectively. Adri,
Deit, Reis, Kato, and Bradley welcome me back to the Phi Psi house like
a returning champ every time. Sophia is a boundless source of creative
energy for activities and I am very sorry for spreading the false rumor
that she broke her leg playing laser tag. Vedant and Hasan show up all
the time in such unexpected places—I look forward to the next time I'm
summoned. Nate continues to outlift me in the gym, and Trun continues to
do things with computers that shock and surprise me. I am routinely
impressed by Daniel's FLiCKS.

### Looking Forward (I Go Back to School Tomorrow)

This was a different quarter. I enjoyed it. This next quarter, I'm going
to build on the positive institutions that were seeded here—continuing
my perpetual search for *better* and *more*. Academically, I'm going
back to the basics with a lot of foundational requirements. I'm looking
forward to it. In the meantime, I'm going to go celebrate getting this
out on time.
