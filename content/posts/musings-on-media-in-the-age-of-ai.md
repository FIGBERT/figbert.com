What does it mean to not "need the media" anymore? Chatbots know nothing
of the observable universe—they are fed media, during and after
training. OpenAI et. al. do not experience events as they happen.
Reporters are on-site witnesses and produce original analyses that
comprise both the news we consume and the content AI is fed.

This is because the greatest challenge has always, in fact, been
monetization. Before the internet, you could sell people the paper your
news was printed on to fund its production. When the internet first
arrived, it was a toy and money wasn't a factor. When real people came
online, money made everything bigger and better but also introduced ads,
engagement, and the rest of that garbage fire because we've all agreed
that web pages are free.

If ChatGPT takes over the internet and we say that news companies can't
make money through their existing channels anymore, they will need to
find yet another way to pay their staff. I hesitate to say that we are
running out of business models, but we are certainly burning through
them at an alarming rate. More importantly they all seem to suck.

Not if there is no content to synthesize, because they have been driven
to bankruptcy. Mass media is an invention, not a necessary constant. If
AI obsoletes the news by providing people with a mouthpiece that they
prefer, without providing a backstop for the companies that produce its
sources, it will run out of material to synthesize.
