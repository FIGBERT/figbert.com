That record of evolution—of a minding shifting and evolving—is in fact
chronological sort's *raison d'être*. If you change your mind about
something you've written, if you've grown in your thinking, or even if
your position has concentrated into a stronger version of what you
already believed: write another post. I would propose that contrasting
those posts over time will probably provide a better understanding of
one's "process adapt[ing]" than just converting your personal website to
a wiki.
