GitHub delenda est. I [currently][tragit] have no [self-hosted solution],
so I'm stranded in the digital bazaar. The above seems neat but far away.
[Tangled] looks promising: it hits the self-hostable but accepting broad
constributions sans-account bullseye, and manages to do so without even
resorting to Drew DeVault's insistence that email can work again. But
the frontend needs work and I don't want to push via SSH.
