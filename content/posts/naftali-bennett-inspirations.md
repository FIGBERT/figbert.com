I recently had the opportunity to meet former Israeli prime minister
[Naftali Bennett]. This was very fun and rather unexpected!

<!-- more -->

During my time with Bennett, he was asked about his "top three
inspirations as a leader." A bit template-y of a question, but I found
his answer to be an interesting listâ€”so I've recorded it here for
posterity:

1. David Ben-Gurion
2. Anwar Sadat
3. Lee Kuan Yew

Perhaps I should go into journalism.
