I was doing my daily HN and Lobster trawling, when I stumbled on [a
post] by [boringcactus] which sounded somewhat familiar. About half way
through I realized it was a truly epic shitpost and genuinely burst out
laughing.

The story begins on February 2, 2021, on Drew Devault's blog, with a
post entitled [*I'm tired of this anti-Wayland horseshit*]. It's a good
read â€“ Drew's a smart guy (he makes [Sourcehut]). In it, he disparages
detractors of Wayland and says that much of the people who criticize it
haven't given it a close enough look and should think about what they're
saying before they go shitting on maintainers of an all-together pretty
dope project.

Seven days later he wrote [*Rust: "Move fast and break things" as a
moral imperative*][rust], in which he criticizes the Rust Foundation's
attitude toward stability and platform support. A fatal mistake. In one
fell swoop, and one `s/Wayland/Rust`, boringcactus ended this man's
career. Check it out:
