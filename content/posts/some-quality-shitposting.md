I was doing my daily HN and Lobster trawling, when I stumbled on [a
post][shitpost] by [boringcactus][boringcactus] which sounded somewhat
familiar. About half way through I realized it was a truly epic
shitpost and genuinely burst out laughing.

The story beings on February 2, 2021, on Drew Devault's blog, with a
post entitled [*I'm tired of this anti-Wayland horseshit*][wayland].
It's a good read â€“ Drew's a smart guy (he makes [Sourcehut][srcht]).
In it, he disparages detractors of Wayland and says that much of the
people who criticize it haven't given it a close enough look and
should think about what they're saying before they go shitting on
maintainers of an all-together pretty dope project.

Seven days later he wrote [*Rust: "Move fast and break things" as a
moral imperative*][rust], in which he criticizes the Rust
Foundation's attitude toward stability and platform support. A fatal
mistake. In one fell swoop, and one `s/Wayland/Rust`, boringcactus
ended this man's career. Check it out:
