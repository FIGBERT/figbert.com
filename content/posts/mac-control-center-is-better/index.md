I've been using the macOS Big Sur Beta for a couple of months now. So far it's pretty fantastic, and a surprisingly smooth experience over all. One brand new feature in this
update is the introduction of the Control Center. A close relation of its iOS counterpart, they differ in one key way: Control Center on macOS actually turns off services.

Did you catch that? It's pretty subtle. When you try and turn off Bluetooth or Wifi on iOS, they aren't actually turned off: they're just temporarily disabled. The interface
still broadcasts, it just doesn't accept new connections. It's one of my biggest pet peeves, and I'm glad Apple got it right with macOS. Now if they could just port it to iOS...
