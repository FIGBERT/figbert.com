I've been using the macOS Big Sur Beta for a couple of months now. So
far it's pretty fantastic, and a surprisingly smooth experience over
all. One brand new feature in this update is the introduction of the
Control Center. A close relation of its iOS counterpart, they differ in
one key way: Control Center on macOS actually turns off services.

Did you catch that? It's pretty subtle. When you try and turn off
Bluetooth or Wifi on iOS, they aren't actually turned off: they're just
temporarily disabled. The interface still broadcasts, it just doesn't
accept new connections. It's one of my biggest pet peeves, and I'm glad
Apple got it right with macOS. Now if they could just port it to iOS...
