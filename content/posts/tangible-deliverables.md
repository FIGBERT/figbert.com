I would like to become the kind of person who consistently produces
discrete works.

I am a big believer in compounding success. You can get used to
thriving, get used to a mindset of novel thought, get used to creating
rather than consuming. You can make it a habit.

We can game our psychology here. However productive you may be in
reality, it is hard to *feel* the progress being made without distinct
milestones. Chipping away at a project of amorphous and twisting scope
is quicksand for your time. Dividing up large goals is key to creating a
feeling of control and—critically—doing real work.

I admire the programmers and designers who throw off project after
project into the public eye. My Mastodon timeline is chock-full of
mockups and demos, people actually *shipping* all the time.

So, I'm working on it.

*This next part is for internal use, but browse at your leisure.*

**In:** blog posts, fun web projects, "mini apps" for Apple platforms,
microblogging but with images/gifs, emailing other internet people,
`/now` and `/using`, videos, livestreaming, art, bamboo (any usage).

**Out:** project multitasking, not publishing, unclear distribution,
false productivity.
