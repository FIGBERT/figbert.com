Just before the start of Rosh Hashanah, I found myself standing over a
kitchen sink. To my left, two pomegranates sat next to a large stainless
steel knife atop a cutting board. Ahead of me, resting in the sink, was
a bowl brimming with water.

To harvest the seeds of a pomegranate, you first cut the fruit into
quarters. These wedges are then submerged in water, where you basically
fidget with the fruit until the segments detach. The red,
semi-translucent seeds sink to the bottom of the bowl while the
white-brown excess floats to the top to be conveniently discarded.

On this particular afternoon, I was in a bit of a rush: I needed seeds
quickly. I threw a couple wedges into the bowl, and started working on
one of them. I finished the wedge and tossed the skin aside.

Without really looking around, I reached out, unfocused, into the waters
of the bowl. After a few seconds, I paused and stared down at the
pomegranate in my hands.

I hadn't put any thought into the motion. I reached out my hand, and
must have been subconsciously tracking the movement of the wedge.
Completely on instinct, I had found a second wedge.

The experience was so seamless it left me mildly startled, observing it
after the fact.

Some keyboard-based programs give the feeling of interfacing directly
with technology, a near echo of the instinctive feeling of working with
your hands. VR and AR aren't there yet, but the applications are fairly
self-evident.

Startlingly seamless is a good experience to aim for as developers.
