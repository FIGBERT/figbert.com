## Hello World

I'm [FIGBERT](/), an Israeli-American high school student with a passion for Computer Science and Engineering. I spend my time coding side-projects, finishing schoolwork, and
playing the occasional videogame. My current goal is to become a full-stack developer, proficient in everything from front-end design to cybersecurity.
