I'm FIGBERT, an Israeli-American programmer building secure, clean, and
effective systems. I use modern technologies to build software that
avoids bloat and unnecessary complexity. I want to work on real and
interesting problems in challenging areas that matter.

## My Work

To see some of the things I do, you can:

- Read my writing [on this site] or in the [Atom feed].
- Check out [Mabel] and [Privacy Redirect for Safari].
- Download [txtodo] on [the App Store] and read the [writeup].
- Take a look at the [source code for this site].
- Play my text adventure, [One Angry Wizard].

I'm constantly working on more stuff, so continue checking back for more
project highlights.

## Web Presence

I host a few things and have accounts in a few places:

- All of [my code] is hosted with [Stagit]
- The corresponding [mailing lists] are on my [Crabmail]
- I am unfortunately still on [Github]
- Professionally lurking on [Twitter]
- Actually quite active these days on [Mastodon]
- I really don't use [Reddit]
- Curing my addiction to [Hacker News]

## Keys and Crypto

You can contact me via email at: [figbert@figbert.com]. Feel free to
encrypt emails to this address with [this PGP key]. For those with more
modern crypto in mind, feel free to use my [age] key. Messages from me
will be signed with my [minisign] key.

If for some reason you want to send me money, feel free to send it to
my [Bitcoin], [Monero], or [ZCash] addresses.

## Elsewhere on the Net

Some people say they have seen me over in [Geminispace].

I have some friends. Some of them have blogs:

- [Burning Silicon] has content on machine learning, computer vision,
  and a variety of other subjects coming out of Purdue University.
- [Jacob Neplokh] co-founded SMMR Software and introduced me to [Tame
  Impala]
- [art3mis] is better at web design than all of us :/
