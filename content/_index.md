## Hello World

I'm FIGBERT, an Israeli-American high school student with a passion for Computer
Science and Engineering. I spend my time coding side-projects, doing schoolwork,
and playing the occasional videogame. My current goal is to become a full-stack
developer, proficient in everything from front-end design to cybersecurity.

I'm constantly working on more stuff, so continue checking back for more project
highlights.
