I'm Benji, an Israeli-American programmer building secure, clean, and
effective systems. I use modern technologies to build software that
avoids bloat and unnecessary complexity. I want to work on real and
interesting problems in challenging areas that matter. I am an
undergraduate student at Stanford University.

### My Work
To see some of the things I do, you can:

- Read my writing [on this site] or in the [Atom feed].
- Check out the [projects I've shipped] and the [code I did it with].
- Sporadically tune in to my [Owncast] livestreams.
- Witness me tentatively embrace social media on [Mastodon].

### Hire Me

For the next three years, I'm available for in-person work anywhere in
the world from June through mid-September. I'm interested in joining
great teams who are pushing the envelope and want to give me a voice in
designing product while I code my ass off.

During the school year, I'm looking for remote-first work, on projects
both long- and short-term, concurrent with my studies.

If any of this speaks to you, [give my CV a once-over][cv].

### Contact
You can contact me via email at: [figbert@figbert.com].  Encrypt your
messages, if you would like, with [age] or [PGP]. If I am signing my
messages I will use [minisign].

Money can go to my [Bitcoin], [Monero], or [ZCash] addresses, where I
will never see it again because I forgot how to use them.

### Elsewhere on the Net
I have some friends. Some of them have blogs:

- [Burning Silicon] has content on machine learning, biotechnology, and cool
  research on many subjects coming out of Pittsburgh.
- [Jacob Neplokh] co-founded [SMMR Software] and introduced me to [Tame
  Impala].
- [R. Miles McCain] is a schoolmate of mine and quick to remind you that
  it is not a matter of skill but rather will.
