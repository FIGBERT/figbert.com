Heyo! I'm FIGBERT, an Israeli-American high school student with a passion for Computer Science and Engineering. I spend
my time coding side-projects, finishing schoolwork, and playing the occasional videogame. My current goal is to become
a full-stack developer, proficient in everything from front-end design to cybersecurity.
