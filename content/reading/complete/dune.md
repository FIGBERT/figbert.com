Really on a "very good, but not my favorite of all time" streak here.
Also, I am now setting the precedent that not all reviews will be
extremely in-depth. In some ways, these are less reviews and more a
reflective log with occasional critique. Regardless: *Dune* rocks.

I first encountered this book as a wee lad when my older sister read the
series. I am happy to have finished the first book all these years
later. It's such a cool world! I'm a sucker for the desert, and I think
this book does it very well. I would love to see Arrakis.

There are many different languages in Dune. The Atreides have a battle
language. Other families have their own secret languages. Fremen have
their own tongue, which incorporate words from another, third language.
I already speak a somewhat esoteric language that covers me in most
American contexts, but I would like to have my own secret language to
communicate in true privacy.

  The final battle nearly gave me a heart attack. Very stressful. Then
  it ended with no George R. R. Martin-esque twist, and instead Paul
  basically totally won against the entire universe. Perhaps
  intellectually disappointing, but very satisfying.

*Dune* is long as hell. I took advantage of a cross-country flight to
knock out most of it. This will factor into my prioritization of
finishing the series. Then again, I'm flying back across the country at
the end of the week...
