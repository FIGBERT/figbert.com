*The Lonely Man of Faith* was a birthday present from a dear friend. It
is written from a perspective that challenges my own, running quite
contrary in some aspects from the way in which I have chosen to live.
Indeed, this is what made it a fascinating book to read: the interaction
of differing opinions and views is where there is perhaps the most room
for growth. Furthermore, *The Lonely Man of Faith* is written at quite
an abstract level, and as such there are many things within its pages
that Rabbi Soloveitchik and I agree on and indeed within which we can
find shared meaning.

Now, assorted quotes and commentary:

> The Halakhah believes that there is only one world—not divisible into
> secular and hallowed sectors...
>
> *Page 79*

This aligns with how I think of Jewishness. I am a Jew in every context,
not just those that may be considered "religious" by those on the
outside.

The dual-nature image of man proposed by Rabbi Soloveitchik is this
book's central focus. At times I find this description becomes fairly
romantic:

> However, [the discovery of a companion], since it is part of the
> redemptive gesture, must also be sacrificial. The medium of attaining
> full redemption is, again, defeat. **This new companionship is not
> attained through conquest, but through surrender and retreat.** "And
> the eternal God caused an overpowering sleep to fall upon the man."
> Adam was overpowered and defeated—and in defeat he found his
> companion.
>
> *Page 38*

The emphasis above is mine. There is something I enjoy about the framing
of deep human relationships being formed through mutual surrender.

If the Rabbi were to appraise my life, I am certain he would say that I
spend far too much time in the conquesting mode of his "Adam the first,"
and it may be beneficial for me to explore other ways of existing.
Perhaps there is value in this. I am certainly sympathetic to, and
involved myself with, the individual search for meaning. However: I do
think there is a vast chasm between that and not touching light switches
on Shabbat.

*The Lonely Man of Faith* is a book of philosophy—it is difficult to
draw from it hard conclusions. Much of the worth of these things comes
from the reading itself, and clashing with the ideas on the page. The
journey, not the destination, as it is said. The book is not long. I
enjoyed it.
