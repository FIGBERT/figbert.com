I stumbled onto [Altamira] during my usual daily web surfing, though
exactly how I can't quite remember nor discern from my browser history.
What I do remember is that I was there for [In The Dark]. [Rocket] was a
delightful surprise. It's not hard to discern from [my previous writing]
that I think Marc Tarpenning is a smart fellow. I was quite excited to
discover another opportunity to hear what he has to say. I'm also a
sucker for bespoke hardware, e-ink screens, and reading books by people
you've met.

After reading, I can affirm that *Rocket* is an altogether pleasant
experience. The fundamental insights about "measure twice, cut once"
that I have already written about apply just as well to NuvoMedia as
they did to early Tesla: Tarpenning writes that they "never varied the
plan" for what they were going to build. His focus on business
models—later important to proving that a market for high-end electric
vehicles might exist—is also present, reflected at NuvoMedia in the
discussion they had around the role of publishers and internet
distribution in the world of e-books.

*Rocket* places a stronger emphasis on a specific method for narrowing
down addressable problem-space than the talk of his that I attended. The
methodology is described succinctly as follows:

> Our thesis, if you will, was looking for products that didn't exist,
> that the technology was just getting good enough to enable.

The examples Tarpenning provides illuminate fun alternate histories that
never quite made it.

The form that this book takes is also quite notable: it is barely longer
than 50 pages in total, heavy in font but light and thin in the hand. It
would not be out of place as an article or a blog post somewhere on the
net. I am a strong proponent of the pamphlet as an art form, so I don't
begrudge the physical manifestation of *Rocket*. I did not, however,
enjoy the layout: were the Federalist Papers written in interview
format?
