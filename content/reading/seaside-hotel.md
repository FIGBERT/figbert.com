I had the great privilege of studying under Michael Holt for two years.
When, two weeks ago, a friend forwarded me and a fellow student of
Holt's [the link to his new book], the three of us immediately purchased
copies and instituted a haphazard book club.

I think it is a very beautiful thing that I am able to read a physical
work written by a friend. Holt has done an incredible thing through the
creation of this tangible relic of his thought and conciousness. I find
it very inspiring. It makes me consider writing in a way more serious
than I ever have before.

The form of the book is independently notable. I am a proponent of
compact, purpose-built objects. I love [my Kindle] because its existence
is limited to precisely what is necessary and nothing more. [Any object]
can be similarly refined. *The Seaside Hotel* is such an object. Its
unique dimensions are subtly unsettling, subverting your assumptions to
break you into a concious focus. Less poetically: it is small and almost
square, light and fun in the hand.

I read the book sitting on a sunlit porch, and then tucked away
stretching out across the length of a light-brown couch. Though I am
concerned this says something about my current mental state, *The
Seaside Hotel* brought me a feeling of contentment. I recommend it to
all.

Though it almost certainly goes without saying, I am excited to see
where Holt goes in the coming years and will follow his works with great
interest.
