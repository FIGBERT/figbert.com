i just finished the counterlife

> Oh wow <br/>

> I honestly don’t remember it all that well anymore

i understand that the whole point is that the book was an interpolation
of the same story in many different interpretations

but it made it a very confusing read

> What was the conflict between the brothers <br/>
> One of them was having an affair?

they were both involved in various differing affairs

i would say that the main conflict is about conceptions of the “good
life”

the playboy vs the father, the jew and the heretic, the diaspora and the
independence

> I should read more of the Zuckerman books
