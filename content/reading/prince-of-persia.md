[Stripe] is bursting with side quests these days. In addition to
providing the "financial infrastructure to grow your revenue" that we
all [know and love], they run [a print magazine] and [a publishing
company]. Scrolling through the website of the latter and feeling
jealous of their stunning visuals, I stumbled on a book about
videogames. Or rather, [one videogame] in particular. Having played
the first level of Aladdin on the SNES and enjoyed the movie adaptation
of [Prince], I thought I might give it a read.

The journal entry form made it an easy read, and the concision of each
note reminded me—for my own practice—that you don't have to write a
novel for every entry to build a compelling narrative or get meaningful
content onto the page. I found Mechner's attention to craft, especially
now in an era where the love of the game has dried up in the shadow of
grifters and generic fortune-seekers, inspirational. A random sample:

> The PC version is maybe 50% of what it should be. I can’t even tell
> these guys what to fix… it’s a million little things, and they’re just
> not up to the hassle. That kind of attention to detail is why the
> Apple version took me two years. This version is probably the best
> I’ll ever get out of them. Oddly enough, this makes me more psyched to
> do the new game. It reminded me why I’m good at this – of what I can
> do that others can't, or won't.

His discussions of money are bizarre and interesting. Either things are
very different now, or I have underappreciated the value of intellectual
property and the amount of work people will do for you with the promise
of an eventual commission. Likely both. In particular: he makes a chunk
of change selling the right to port his games to other platforms. Modern
game engines abstract away much of this process, and even without this
help there are only three desktop platforms and three consoles worth
thinking about—strictly less than in his day. But I will keep in mind
the value of an agent shopping your work around, should I ever decide to
do something like screenwriting, as well as the benefits and drawbacks
of working on a personal creative project within the bounds of a
corporate partner (as he does with Prince of Persia via Broderbund).

It's a thoroughly Bay Area book as well. To interpolate a
seasonally-appropriate phrase: reading this, I am presented with a
narrative of events from his time but in *this place*. It's trippy: he
eats at Marin Joe's! I suppose I should have assumed from the general
vibe of that restaurant that it had been there forever. To top it all
off, there's this lovely paragraph:

> Man, it’s great to be back. When I got into my rented car and hit
> Highway 280, I laughed out loud, I was so thrilled. The trees, the
> colors, the quality of the sunlight… San Francisco is the most
> beautiful city on the planet.

Should Mechner ever feel compelled to release a sequel from the period
in which Prince was being adapted to a feature film, I would immediately
give it a read. For someone so in love with both making games and
writing films, I'm sure it was a crowning acheivement.
