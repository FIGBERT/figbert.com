I got this book (and had it signed) on Election Night. Lévy had come to
visit the Stanford Hillel, to philosophize with students and watch as
the votes were called. A student asked him at one point how he could be
so certain that the West and its allies would triumph over the rising
Axis of Resistance. I remember I was struck by his response: "Of course
they will. It is good against evil, the evil must lose. It will be
defeated. That is what happens."

This book will do little to convince those who may disagree with what it
has to say. It presents few novel facts to those who share his
positions. It is a position piece: a statement, for anyone who is
interested, to read and comprehend the contours of Lévy's beliefs.

Two further notes:
1. However much of a conversational tone I believe myself to impart on
   my writing, Lévy has vastly more.
2. I have never appreciated how vastly different the Francophone world
   is from its Anglophone counterpart.

I would be interested in hearing how Lévy's thoughts have evolved in the
time since the publication of *Israel Alone*. It is not quite that the
book is outdated, but with the pace of change in the Middle East today,
there is certainly much more to discuss.
