If youâ€™re looking to reach me, you can find my Twitter {{< fab twitter >}}, Reddit {{< fab reddit >}}, and Github {{< fab github >}} profiles, as well as my Stellar, Bitcoin {{< fab btc >}}, and ZCash addresses on [Keybase {{< fab keybase >}}](https://keybase.io/figbert) (my Keybase proof for this site can be found [here](../keybase.txt)). If you want to send me Monero {{< fab monero >}}, you can send it to [this address](../monero-address.txt).

You can also contact me via my email {{< fas envelope >}} at: f1gb3rt at protonmail dot com. Feel free to encrypt any emails to me with [this PGP key](../publickey-pgp.txt).

Protecting my identity under the FIGBERT pseudonym was/is really hard, so let's hope linking all of my profiles in the same place doesn't ruin that ;). Hello, bots + big data.
