## Bonus round from this year
Talked with an a mentor of mine—an successful startup founder,
executive, and angle investor of some reknown—who said that people
don't want message aggregation. Separation of concerns through distinct
apps is actually a feature. Benji insight derived from that: the
super-app that aggregates your different messaging platforms already
exists and is just the operating system.
