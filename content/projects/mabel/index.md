[**Mabel**] is a fancy BitTorrent client for the terminal. Programmed in
performant and memory-safe [Go], the TUI is the torrenting
state-of-the-art on macOS and Linux (and anywhere UNIX-y).

Keyboard-centric, terminal-based workflows provide developers with a
sense of focus and control unparalleled by the GUI. In my personal use
of such programs (like [NeoVim], [Amfora], and many others), I noticed a
distinct lack of functional torrent clients: existing options were
dated, spewed logs to `stdout`, and proved generally disappointing.
Mabel modernizes torrenting from the command line.

Mabel builds on the excellent work of many others in the open-source
community, like [Charm] and [anacrolix]. It's the second public release
of [SMMR Software], a collaboration between [FIGBERT] and [Jacob
Neplokh].

Mabel is available through a package manager near you. For more, explore
the source code [on GitHub][**Mabel**].
