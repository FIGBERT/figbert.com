![A canvas with the words "You are running out of time" written across
it in all-caps](preview.png)

My little sister was listening to [the Hamilton soundtrack] yesterday,
and as I was listening I got hung up on a particular line.

> How do you write like you're running out of time?

I remember my older sister once told me a story that Steve Jobs had a
calendar on the wall with a circle for every week in the average
lifespan. At the end of every week, she said, Jobs would fill in a
circle. One down, a discrete and finite amount left to go. The [sands of
time]. [Memento] [mori]. You are running out of time.

The wallpaper was made in Affinity Photo. It responds dynamically to
light and dark mode thanks to [Equinox]. The font [smells of sea foam].
