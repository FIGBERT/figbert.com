[**d3c3nt**] is a simple, clean, and flexible theme for [Zola]. The
theme evolved from use on my site, made with vanilla CSS and HTML – and
completely sans Javascript. All in all, it's fairly... decent.

<!-- more -->

d3c3nt styles common HTML elements like headers, paragraphs, and lists;
plus semantic elements like blockquotes, tables, abbreviations, [and
more]. It also provides [custom shortcodes] to incorporate modern web
elements in your markdown.

To see the theme in action, poke around [the demo instance][**d3c3nt**]
– and explore the source code [on my forge].
