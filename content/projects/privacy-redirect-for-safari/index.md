[**Privacy Redirect for Safari**] is a web extension that automatically
redirects sites to alternative front-ends like [Nitter] and [Teddit].
These front-ends provide users with ways to access the content of
popular platforms, without exploiting your private information. Until
now, extensions that could redirect to these front-ends were limited to
users of Chrome and Firefox. Privacy Redirect for Safari expands this
functionality to Apple's native browser.

Unlike other browsers, for many years Safari did not encourage the
development of extensions. However, recent updates from Apple have
signaled a change in direction, and useful extensions for Safari can
finally be developed. Privacy Redirect for Safari is one of the first of
this new wave of extensions.

Privacy Redirect for Safari is the first step in creating a wealth of
high-quality extensions for Safari. It's built with the latest and
greatest in Apple technologies, like SwiftUI and [Safari Web
Extensions].

Privacy Redirect for Safari is a fork of Simon Brazell's [Chrome and
Firefox extension], porting the extension's functionality to Safari.
It solves one of the most frustrating problems with front-ends like
[Nitter] – the need to manually edit links – by having the browser
edit them for you.

Privacy Redirect for Safari is the first public release of [SMMR
Software], a collaboration between [FIGBERT] and [Jacob Neplokh]. It's
currently available for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.
