[**txtodo**][txtodo] is a minimalist open-source todo list app
inspired by Jeff Huang's [*One File to Rule Them All*][ofrta] and
[Mac-assed Mac apps][mma] like [IINA][iina], [Sketch][sktch], and
Safari. It's available for download on iOS and macOS via the App
Store.

![txtodo on MacOS Big Sur, with no tasks][macos]

txtodo lists your immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things
done without overthinking it. At midnight, all tasks are discarded so
you can start fresh tomorrow. You can also create up to three
long-term tasks that "float" with you from day-to-day.

On 15 February 2020, I deleted my account with Trello. A solo
developer, I know my projects inside and out. I know what features
need work, and which graphics need a refresh. I don't need a massive
[crudware][crud] suite keep track of every little move. I need
something small.

![txtodo on iOS 14, with no tasks][ios]

A dead-simple UX and midnight expiration date prevents the
overwhelming buildup of tasks we delay over and over again, and helps
you deal only with tasks you can get done *that day*.
