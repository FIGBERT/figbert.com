[**txtodo**] is a minimalist open-source todo list app inspired by Jeff
Huang's [*One File to Rule Them All*] and [Mac-assed Mac apps] like
[IINA], [Sketch], and Safari. It's available for download on iOS and
macOS via the App Store.

![txtodo on MacOS Big Sur, with no tasks][macos]

txtodo lists your immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things
done without overthinking it. At midnight, all tasks are discarded so
you can start fresh tomorrow. You can also create up to three long-term
tasks that "float" with you from day-to-day.

On 15 February 2020, I deleted my account with Trello. A solo developer,
I know my projects inside and out. I know what features need work, and
which graphics need a refresh. I don't need a massive [crudware] suite
to keep track of every little move. I need something small.

![txtodo on iOS 14, with no tasks][ios]

A dead-simple UX and midnight expiration date prevents the overwhelming
buildup of tasks we delay over and over again, and helps you deal only
with tasks you can get done *that day*.

Download the app [on the App Store], and explore the source code [on my
forge].
